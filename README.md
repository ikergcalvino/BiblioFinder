# BiblioFinder

## Description

In a post-pandemic context of COVID-19, where it was vital to avoid gatherings in enclosed spaces and maintain social distancing, difficulties arose in accessing various public places such as libraries for students. This work creates a solution to this problem by developing an Android application that provides users with a practical, convenient, and quick way to check the availability of spaces for studying or working in libraries belonging to their university community.

The system is based on NFC technology for occupancy control. The system architecture includes a frontend developed in Android, a backend managing authentication and workstation management, and a database storing user and booking information. This solution enables efficient management of study spaces, thereby improving the user experience in libraries.
